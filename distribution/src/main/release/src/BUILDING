Building the Apache Tuscany SCA 1.6.1 November 2010 Release source distribution
===============================================================================

Initial Setup
-------------

1) Install either of the following:
   a) Java SE 5.0 SDK (version 1.5.0_22 or higher), which can be downloaded from
      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp
   b) Java SE 6.0 SDK (version 1.6.0_07 or higher), which can be downloaded from
      http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads

2) Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the installed 
   JDK location, and that your PATH includes %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or 
   $JAVA_HOME$/bin (unix).

3) Install Maven 2.0.10 or higher, which can be downloaded from 
   http://maven.apache.org/download.html. Make sure that your PATH includes 
   the $M2_HOME$/bin directory. 

4) Make sure that your MAVEN_OPTS environment variable has -Xmx256m (or more)
   and -XX:MaxPermSize=256m (or more). You can do this manually by executing
   the following in your prompt:
   Windows users:
     set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
   Unix users:
     export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx256m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m


Building
--------

1) Change to the top level directory of the Apache Tuscany SCA source distribution.
2) Run

	$> mvn

   This will compile Apache Tuscany SCA and run all of the tests in the source
   distribution. 

   Depending on the load of remote Maven 2.0 repositories, you may have 
   to run 'mvn' several times utill the required dependencies are 
   all located in your local maven repository. It usually takes some time for 
   maven to download required dependencies in the first build. Once all the 
   dependencies have been downloaded you may use the -o option to run maven
   in offline mode, for example, 'mvn clean install -o'.


Building the distributions
--------------------------

1) Change to the distribution folder
2) Run

	$> mvn

   This will build the binary and source distributions with .zip and .gz 
   formats in the distribution/target directory.


Using an IDE
------------

The easiest way to work with Apache Tuscany SCA in an IDE is to use Maven to
generate all of the IDE project files for you automatically. This works best
if you generate IDE projects for all of the Apache Tuscany modules. You can
then include the ones you are interested in working with in your IDE. 

To build IDE project files for all of the modules in Apache Tuscany SCA;

cd <sca-dir>

where <sca-dir> is the top-level directory containing the all the
Apache Tuscany SCA source code.  

If you are an Eclipse user do the following

mvn eclipse:eclipse
mvn -Declipse.workspace=<path-to-eclipse-workspace> eclipse:add-maven-repo

If you are an IDEA user do the following 

mvn idea:idea

These commands generate project files for each module in Apache Tuscany SCA. 
The modules you are interested in can now be included in your IDE.

For example, in Eclipse, if you create a new Java project and use the option
to "create a new project from existing source" you can specify an SCA module
directory, which includes the generated project files, and Eclipse will treat
it like any other Java project.
