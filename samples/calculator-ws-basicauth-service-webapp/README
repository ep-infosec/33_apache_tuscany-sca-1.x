This webapp contains the SCA calcualtor application and exposes the
Add service over the web service binding. The web.xml file is configured
to enable basic authentication for this application in Tomcat. It ensures
that all incomming requests are associated with the "tuscany" role

The intention is that you install this application into tomcat and defined
the "tuscany" role in the conf/tomcat-users.xml file. An example tomcat-users.xml 
file is provided that shows you how to do this. 

Once started you can use the calculator-ws-basicauth-reference sample to call this 
service. Its Calcualtor component add reference is configured for basic authentication
and the samples definitions.xml file contains the correct username and password.
